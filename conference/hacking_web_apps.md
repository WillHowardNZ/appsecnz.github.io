## Course Details 

**Dates:** Wednesday and Thursday, 10-11 February 2021

**Time:** 8:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (NZDT), each day

**Instructor:** Anirudh Anand, [7A Security](https://7asecurity.com/)   

**Course Fee:** NZ $900.00 (plus GST and ticketing fees)

**Registration Site:** [https://events.humanitix.com/appsecnz-training](https://events.humanitix.com/appsecnz-training)

**Prerequisite Skills:**

This course has no prerequisites as it is designed to accommodate students with different skills: - Advanced students will enjoy comprehensive labs, extra miles and CTF challenges - Less experienced students complete what they can during the class, and can continue at their own pace from home using the training portal.

This said, the more you learn about the following ahead of the course, the more you will get out of the course:

* Linux command line basics
* Basic knowledge of Node.js or JavaScript is not required, but would help.

**Attendees Should Have:** 

A laptop with the following specifications: 
  * Ability to connect to wireless and wired networks
  * Ability to read PDF files
  * Administrative rights: USB allowed, the ability to deactivate AV, firewall, install tools, etc.
  * Knowledge of the BIOS password, in case VT is disabled
  * Minimum 8GB of RAM (recommended: 16GB+)
  * 60GB+ of free disk space (to copy a lab VM and other goodies)
  * VirtualBox 6.0 or greater, including the "VirtualBox Extension Pack"
  
**Attendees Will Receive:**

* Lifetime access to training portal, with all course materials
* Unlimited access to future updates and step-by-step video recordings
* Unlimited email support, if you need help while you practice at home later
* Interesting vulnerable apps​ to practice
* Digital copies of all training material
* Custom Build Lab VMs
* Purpose-built Vulnerable Test apps
* Source code for test apps

## Course Overview

This course is the culmination of years of experience gained via practical penetration testing of Modern Web applications as well as countless hours spent doing research. We have structured this course around the OWASP Security Testing Guide, it covers the OWASP Top Ten and specific attack vectors against Modern Web apps. This course provides participants with actionable skills that can be applied immediately from day 1.

Please note our courses are 100% hands-on, we do not lecture students with boring bullet points and theories, instead we give you practical challenges and help you solve them, teaching you how to troubleshoot common issues and get the most out of this training. Training then continues after the course through our frequently updated training portal, for which you keep lifetime access, as well as unlimited email support.

Light on the theory, heavy on the practice, each day starts from the basics but quickly complicates things to uncover fun attacks and edge cases that will surprise many. Each day covers static analysis, dynamic checks and finishes off with a nice CTF session to test the skills gained.

**Day 1​:** Focused specifically on Hacking Modern Web Apps: We start with understanding Modern Web Apps and then deep dive into static and dynamic analysis of the applications at hand. This day is packed with hands-on exercises and CTF-style challenges.

**Day 2:** Dedicated to Advanced Modern Web App Attacks: We cover advanced attacks specifically targeting the Modern Web App and other platforms such as dumping memory, prototype pollution, deserialization attacks, OAuth, JWT flaws and more. The day is full of hands-on exercises and ends with CTF-style open challenges for additional practice.

## Course Objectives

This course will take any student and make sure that:

* The general level of proficiency is much higher than when they came
* The skills acquired can be immediately applied to modern Web app security assessments
* Skills can be sharpened via continued education in our training portal for free
* The student is equipped to defeat common Web app assessment challenges
* Everybody will learn a lot in this training
* Advanced students will come out with enhanced skills and more efficient workflows
* The skills gained are highly practical and applicable to real-world assessments
